# File Unifying

File Unifying is a unique possibility to add **LEGAL**/**LEGIT** chunks to your current (**Superflat?**) world. Before using the trick it is important to see the [Impact](Impact.md) section of this documentation.

## Example: Superflat (No Structures)

In this example we will try to add default chunks to a **Superflat - No Structures - No Bonus Chest** world.

### Adding 1.6.4 Chunks

Before starting, make sure to check out the [Setting Up](SettingUp.md) section.

#### Target World

***Note:** If this is your first time doing this trick we suggest you to make a new world first to start learning how it works.*
*Refer to [Initializing World](InitializingWorld.md) section to ready your world.*

First, create a new world and name the world exactly as the **modern**/**target** world.
*Want to know why? Check out the [Explained](Explained.md) section.*

Change the options how you like. In our example we will add chunks to the modern superflat world, so we enable **Structures** (for stronghold) and set the world type to **Default** (for the world chunks we want).

Generating the world...

Load in the spawn chunks...

You need to generate chunks outside the spawn chunks so that it will not be overwritten when changing back to superflat.
In this example  we explored the world in **legit** survival (You can also use creative mode and generate that way, but in our opinion to not count **File Unifying** as cheating we explore the new chunks in survival).

We found the stornghold, save these coordinates because in the modern **Superflat** world the stornghold will be in the exact same position.

**Important:** Quit the world in chunks that are not important (These chunks will be deleted).

### Initializing 1.6.4 Chunks In The Modern World

To switch back to **superflat**, you need to load the file one time on your modern version.

Join and leave the world again (You can see why that is needed in the next step).

### Switching Back To Superflat

As you can see, the world has disappeared in version (**1.6.4**).
Now we can make the world one more time and switch back to **Superflat**.

Make a new world and name it the same as the modern world.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TRSTN4/FileUnifyingMinecraft/main/img/2022-11-10%2000_47_46-Minecraft%201.19.2.png?)

Set the world back to **Superflat** and join the world (if you want to use **File Unifying** for **Superflat**).

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TRSTN4/FileUnifyingMinecraft/main/img/2022-11-10%2000_47_55-Minecraft%201.19.2.png?)

**NOTE:** You will die because of fall damage (or try to MLG :P).

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TRSTN4/FileUnifyingMinecraft/main/img/2022-11-10%2001_05_54-Minecraft%201.19.2.png?)

Leave the world again. Your world is now succesfully **unified**.

### Unifying Complete

If you now join the world in your modern version you can explore the old superflat world progress and enjoy the new chunks with it.

Loaded into the world succesfully.

The loaded (**1.6.4**) chunks and the new minus (**Y**) level chunks.

Climbing to the top you can enjoy the new chunks (and biomes).

Walking to the (**1.6.4**) stronghold cordinates you will see that indeed the stronghold is there aswell.

### That's It!

That was all, you succesfully completed **File Unifying**.
