# Impact

The impact of using this trick depends on how many chunks you render in (**1.6.4**).

## Chunks

Rendering a chunk in (**1.6.4**) will have these effects on your modern world (***superflat?***).

### Positive

The positive list:

- Adds (**1.6.4**) Biomes to your modern world
- Adds many new building possibilities
- Adds nearly **95%** of the currently unobtainable items to superflat
- Adds the new deepslate caves to superflat
- Adds Ancient City possibility to your superflat
- Newer blocks will not get deleted or corrupted when switching to (**1.6.4**)
- Its not cheating
- So much fun and exploration

### Negative

The negative list:

- Spawn chunks will be reset and set to Superflat (**1.6.4**) (**Y**) level height
- Biomes above version (**1.6.4**) can't be added

## Cheating?

Does this count as **cheating**?
In my opinion not, here's a list why not:

- You did not use commands
- You did not use mods
- You did not change the files
- You did not use datapacks
- Its all in default Minecraft
