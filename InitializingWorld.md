# Initializing World

***Note:** You can also use your already created worlds for **File Unifying** but we suggest to create a new world if this is your first time.*

## Creating A New World

Since we want to start playing Minecraft we need to create a new world. So lets start by creating one!

### Creating the World

First name your world, this is the most important part of the trick. See the red circle? this is how your world will be named in your file system so remember this exact name.

In this whole documentation we are going to play on a ***Superflat - No Structures, No Bonus Chest*** world. The goal is to get biomes and materials that are unobtainable in superflat.

Rendering the world...

And there we go, we got a new **Superflat** world!

Now close the game so that it saves in your file system.

After navigating to the **.minecraft** saves folder we can see that your newly created world is successfully in the saves folder.

### That's It!

Now that we created a new world, we can start **File Unifying**! Go the the last section [File Unifying](FileUnifying.md) to start the trick.
